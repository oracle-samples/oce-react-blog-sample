# About React Blog Sample

This repository holds the sample source code for a ReactJS implementation of a blog site powered by Oracle Content Management.

Please see the complete [tutorial](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=cloud&id=oce-react-blog-sample) and the live [demo](https://headless.mycontentdemo.com/samples/oce-react-blog-sample).

## Installation

Run the following to install the dependencies needed by this sample:

```shell
npm install
```

## Running the project

> **NOTE:** If you need to use a proxy to reach the internet then define an oce_https_proxy environment variable:  

```shell
export oce_https_proxy=<scheme>://<proxyhost>:<port>
```

### Development

During development the dev script should be used:

```shell
npm run dev
```

This script builds the client and server bundles and starts the application in a local server. Webpack will watch for code changes and recreate the client and server bundles as required.

### Production

For production the build script should be used to build the client and server bundles. Run it using:

```shell
npm run build
```

When the script completes the application can be started using:

```shell
npm run start
```

and then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
